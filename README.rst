django-feature-policy
=====================

django-feature-policy is now `django-permissions-policy <https://pypi.org/project/django-permissions-policy/>`__.

This package is now solely a shim to pull in the new name, and can be safely swapped for just ``django-permissions-policy`` in your dependencies.
